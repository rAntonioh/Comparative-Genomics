[CompBio Teaching](http://compbio.mit.edu/teaching.html)

This is Chapter 22 in the latest textbook draft.


(b) Compare the structure of the chapter to last yearâ€™s lecture slides. Is the chapter organization clear and logical? Are the section divisions logical and is the material presented in each section relevant? Are transitions between paragraphs and sections smooth? Should large topics be divided into smaller portions that may be easier to understand? Rate the structure of the chapter on a scale of 1 (awful) to 10 (superb) and explain your assessment.

(c) Is the chapter well written and understandable? Are some sections awkward and need to be reworked? How clear and easy to follow is the material on algorithms and computational methods in your chapter? How clear and easy to follow is the material on biological questions? Rate the clarity of the chapter on a scale of 1 to 10 and explain your assessment.

(d) Are some sections stubs and need to be expanded? Would additional relevant material or examples make the chapter easier to understand or more interesting? Rate the completeness of the chapter on a scale of 1 to 10 and explain your assessment.

(e) Are the figures and figure legends clear? Are they useful to the reader? Is there any material presented in figures that would be better expressed in the main text, or vice versa? Are there any figures in the slides that would make the notes clearer? Would creating additional figures be helpful? Do the legends adequately describe the figures? Are the tables in the chapter useful and would additional tables help clarify the material? Rate the quality of the figures, tables, and figure legends on a scale of 1 to 10 and explain your assessment.

(f) Rate the overall quality of the chapter on a scale of 1 to 10 and explain your assessment.

(g) What improvements to the chapter are most needed to make it more useful to students? How do you plan to revise the chapter?
